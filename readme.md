#OEUnit

OEUnit is a unit testing framework for OpenEdge ABL . OEUnit is intended to help write and run repeatable unit tests - similar to JUnit and other xUnit-based unit testing frameworks.

For full documentation, see **doc/index.html** in the repository.

##Change Log
###1.3

- Fixed bug where the results window would display for a moment and then disappear.
- Fixed bug where compile error 468 is thrown when r-code already exists for a test class (Compile aborted. SAVE not specified and r-code file exists)
- Fixed bug the DYNAMIC-NEW failed to create an instance based on the class file-name alone. When r-code was also present in the directory.
